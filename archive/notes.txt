ammo tracker broken

figure out why dmg numbers flicker when more than 1 on screen at a time

brighten/dampen ability colors based on whether or not target enemy in range?

Make event log errors red

add level up flash msg (also important messages)
add partial loot pickup to respect inventory space

You win on boss kill

Don't respawn on kill? respawn timer instead? Or let whole room die off and regenerate on map entry?

Woah, what if there was a class that focused on spawning small, temporary battle ships?

And one that focused on DoTs?

And one that focused on AoE?

Diablo/Borderlands gear system w/ weapons/shield drops
  elements
    electric=shield
    corrossive=DoT chance

# Weapon Stats
  attack speed
  damage

# Weapon Affixes

# SIMPLIFIED EQUIPMENT STARTING OUT

Ship
  Base HP
  Num shield slots
  Num laser slots
  Num generator slots

Then the player has a ship, which has a sprite, and the ship has weapons equipped to it, which have dmg/attack speed stats



# --------------------------------------

& add attack queueing mechanism
& add thin autoattack progress bar - nah, this is fine

abilities:
  blink ability? short teleport in current direction?
  add rocket CD
  add temporary speed increase CD
  super long range pull move that does basically no dmg?
  radial AoE blast outward from player?
  take no dmg for 3 seconds?
  45 second invis?
  a dot
  AoE freeze
    w/ attacking still or possibly full stun

talents:
  on kill, get 10 hp over 10 seconds
  multiplier for picking up resources
  % dmg increase
  % speed increase
  enable slow healing @ portals
  enable selling @ portals?
  % increase to bonus boxes
  % increase to loot drops
  resource collection range increase?

add defense stat?
consider increasing FPS?

IMPORTANT: Absolutely screw this for now rofl. The complexity of this absolutely exploded way beyond what I'm ready for. All I want out of this is a single map, a single player, my 10 cycling resources just like I had, and maybe 5 cycling enemies to kill that move around and attack back. Maybe build out a simple repair button and then probs leave it at that - end of the project

Next project should just be marginally more complex

should attack range/resource collection range be the same thing?

what if there was a stun CD?
  combined with attack range increase, you could pretty much kite

& what about rockets?

what about repairing away from base?
  what about a health potion or something?
  purchase the ability to heal at portals?

add health bars above player/enemy during combat

add dmg numbers into canvas during combat

what if there was good AoE and a very long-range, weak attack for pulling enemies?

what if I made this or another game like a Diablo-oriented pwnfest?
  pulling piles of crap, nuking it down with AoE, gobbling up the nommage, etc.

add starting menu w/ ability to save/load/new game?
